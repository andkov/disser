1. Create (generate) four datasets in the following scales:
continuous - numeric
discrete - integer
ordinal - ordered
nominal - factor
see my notes for diagrams.


2. Create graphical databox representations of each of them (4)
  - use ggplot

3. Transform the raw databox view into summarized view
  - we lack one dimension, so we create it with "display of statistics" 
  - show how to solve this problem, escape the flatland
