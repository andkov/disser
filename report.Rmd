Title
========================================================

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring web pages (click the **Help** toolbar button for more details on using R Markdown).

When you click the **Knit HTML** button a web page will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```

<!-- Point knitr to the underlying code file so it knows where to look for the chunks. -->
```{r, echo=FALSE}
pathSourceCode <- file.path(getwd(), "index.R")
#This allows knitr to call chunks tagged in the underlying PrototypeCode.R file.
read_chunk(pathSourceCode) 
```
