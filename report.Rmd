```{r }
# Diamond Cut, Size, and Price

Diamonds with an _ideal_ cut have a lower median price.

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=4, fig.cap="Boxplot of Diamond Prices by Cut", echo=FALSE}
# graphics packages
require(ggplot2, quietly=TRUE)

# boxplot
qplot(cut, price, data = diamonds, geom = "boxplot")
```

One explanation for this unexpected finding is that ideal cut diamonds also tend to be **smaller**.  
The mean is \(E(carat | cut = Ideal) = `r mean(subset(diamonds, cut == "Ideal")$carat)`\), and size is related to price.

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(lm(price ~ carat, data = diamonds))
```
```
